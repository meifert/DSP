2. CONNECTING THE DSK TO YOUR PC
   -----------------------------

   1) First, turn off the power to your PC.
   2) Connect an RS232 cable to either COM1 or COM2 of your PC.
   3) If needed, connect an RS232 25 to 9 pin adapter.
   4) Connect the DSK to the other end of the RS232 cable.
   5) Connect the 9 VAC transformer to the DSK.
   6) Plug the 9 VAC transformer into the wall.
   7) Turn on the power to your PC
   8) Install the DSK software using DSKINSTL.BAT batch bile.
      Type C:\dskinstl ?  where ? is either a: or b:

3. RS232 CABLES REQUIREMENTS
   -------------------------
     The DSK requires a 9 pin RS232C connection to the PC host. If your comm
   port has a 25 pin connector, you will need a 25 to 9 pin adapter. These
   parts can be purchased from Radio Shack. The catalog numbers are listed
   below:
           9 -to- 9 pin RS232 link (Cat No. 26-117)
           25 -to- 9 pin RS232 adapter (Cat No. 26-1388)


4. POWER SUPPLY
   ------------
   The DSK requires a 9 VAC (>250 mA) UL class 2 transformer.  The DSK power
   jack accepts 2.1mm (2.5mm in older revisions) plugs which are common to many
   wall mount AC transformers.  A low current UL listed transformer is
   recommended for the DSK module since they are designed to withstand most
   power faults for a brief period of time.

   IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS, IMMEDIATELY UNPLUG THE TRANSFORMER FROM THE WALL
   and check that your connections are correct. In the United States a
   suitable transformer (9 VAC, 1.3A) can be purchased from Radio Shack.
   (Cat. No. 273-1611A). If you have an older version DSK which accepts the
   2.5mm plug, the catalog number is 274-1568.


5. SETTING UP THE DSK SOFTWARE
   ---------------------------

   BACK UP THE ORIGINAL DSK DISKETTE AND KEEP IT IN A SAFE PLACE!

   On a DOS command line type the following:

                       C:\> dskinstl a:    (installing from drive a:\)

    This will exectute a batch file and creates a sub-directory named C:\DSK.
    It copies all files from the original DSK diskette into the C:\DSK
    sub-directory.

    If you plan to develop code in another directory you may also want to
    add the DSK directory to the PATH setup statement in AUTOEXEC.BAT

    Edit the PATH statement in AUTOEXEC.BAT as follows....

    PATH C:\DOS;C:\MOREDIRS;C:\DSK  <== APPEND ";C:\DSK" TO THE PATH SETUP


    Reboot your computer. Type the following to execute the debugger/monitor
    program. Make sure DSK is powered up and connected to the computer.

    C:\DSK> DSK5D         <== Execute the DSK Debug/Monitor program

    At this time the DSK Debugger program (DSK5D) will attempt to setup
    communicate between your PC and DSK.  If the DSK5D is succesfull a screen
    will appear with display boxes for the CPU registers, memory, dissasembly
    and watch. If DSKD could not establish communications, it may display an
    error message or continually attempt a connection.

    Once DSK5D has been started, try loading the test file FUNC.DSK under the
    \APPS directory.  This is done by hitting the "L" key for load, followed by
    "D" for DSK in the sub-menu. Note how the top line changed to the sub-menu
    when you hit the "L" key. Next type "FUNC.DSK" into the file to load field,
    then hit enter. If everything worked the file should now be loaded and
    ready to run.

    With FUNC.DSK now loaded into the DSK module, try single stepping the
    monitor by hitting the "space" bar.  As you step through the code you
    should see the registers and memory being modified by the CPU.  To single
    step a set number of times (without hitting "space" all the time) enter "X"
    for eXecute, followed by "N" to enter the number of steps. You then enter a
    value and hit enter.  To free RUN the DSK, enter "X" for execute, followed
    by "G" for Go.  To halt the DSK hit the "ESC" key.

    In the event of an error, the COM port, baud rate and ROM revision can
    be directly specified on the command line when DSK5D is invoked.  The
    DSK5D invocation help panel can be displayed from DOS by entering

    C:\DSK> DSK5D ?      <= HINT: Many DOS applications use ? for online help


6. SPECIFICATIONS
   --------------
     Power Supply:INPUT: 9 VAC, 250 mA minimum, UL Class 2 transformer
                  OUTPUT: +/-5  VDC regulated, <50 mA
                         +/-12 VDC unregulated, <50 mA, <4V ripple (no load)
        Analog In: +/-3V max
       Analog Rin: 100 Kohm typ
       Analog Out: +/-3V typ into 600 ohm load
            RS232: Requires TX,TR,DTR and GROUND.
                   RS232 output is +/-5V minimum into 600 ohms

   NOTE: The DC supplies are affected by external loading.  Loads in excess of
         50 mA may create excessive ripple that may cause the 5VDC regulators
         or RS232 driver to not operate properly.  If you plan to expand the
         DSK with external memory, I/O devices etc... you will likely need
         to use an external supply.
