This file explains the procedure to convert the DSK communications kernal
(DSK5D.ASM) source code to a EPROM programmer file.

Step 1.   Use the DSPA assembler (TI fixed-point assembler version 6.40) to
          assemble the communications kernal. (.obj file)
           > Command: DSPA -V50 DSK5D.ASM

Step 2.   Link the communications kernal object file using the TI fixed-point
          linker version 6.40 and linker command file (DSK5D.CMD). The output
          will be a COFF (.OUT) file.
           > Command: DSPLNK DSP5D.CMD

Step 3.   Convert the COFF file to an EPROM programmer format using the TI Hex
          conversion Utilities version 6.40. The Hex converter uses the command
          file called BOOT.CMD.
           > Command: DSPHEX BOOT.CMD

          To verify the conversion process was successful, the checksum
          located in the Hex converter output (DSK5D.I0) should be '7E63'.
          If the DSK5D.ASM file was modified in any way, the checksum will be
          different.
