This file explains how to run the application code on either the DSK debugger
(DSK5D.EXE) or the DSK Loader (DSK5L.EXE).



The TMS320C5x DSK software package contains applications code for testing the
DSK memory, setting up the AIC and testing out the host/target communications
interface. The three application programs are listed below:

   I. SELFTEST.OUT   ==> Automatic test file for the DSK board.
  II. FUNC.DSK       ==> File allow you to check the AIC
 III. DSK_SPEC.DSK   ==> Allow you to display the spectrum on the OSC.


I. SELFTEST.OUT
   ============
   1. Connect the DSK to the RS232 properly and copy SELFTEST.OUT under
      the working directory.

   2. Run the test file by exexcuting the DSK loader with the following
      parameters:
         DSK5L -A -C1          (If using comport 1)
         DSK5L -A -C2          (If using comport 2)

      The parameters passed to DSK5L tell the program to automatically
      load the file SELFTEST.OUT and execute. First DSK5L will fill the
      DSK internal memory with a specified pattern then read them out to
      check the DSK memory. After memory test the SELFTEST was loaded and
      used to test the AIC. If any test failed or the test is finished DSK5L
      will stop execution.

   3. A good DSK will respond with the following messages

      DSK-RS232 LOOP                  PASSED
      Check Data Memory B0            0x0100  0x0300
      >>>>>>>>                        PASSED
      Check Data Memory B1            0x0300  0x0500
      >>>>>>>>                        PASSED
      Check Data Memory SARAM         0x0a00  0x2c00
      >>>>>>>>                        PASSED
      AIC test                        Send -> 0xb000  Receive -> 0x8000
                                PASSED!
        Your DSK already passed the test !!!

   4. If any of the tests fail a  'TEST FAILED' message will be generated
      and DSK5L will stop execution.  If the RS232 link cannot be established,
      DSK5L will likely not load and SELFTEST will not be attempted.  If there
      are problems, go to the section "DSK5L COMMUNICATIONS AND SUB-FEATURES"
      in this document.


II. FUNC.DSK
    ========
   1. Connect the DSK to the RS232 properly. Connect a small, low power speaker
      to the DSK output RCA jack.

   2. Run the DSK debugger program by typing the following:
         DSK5D

      If the debugger did not build the communication link, try to change the
      comport or reduce the baud rate. Be sure the PC's baud rate is similar to
      the baud rate of the DSK.

   3. After the debugger screen appears, load the FUNC.DSK file by hitting the
      "L" key for LOAD, followed by "D" for DSK-format file in the sub-menu.
      Next type "FUNC.DSK" at the prompt to load the file, and hit enter. The
      screen will show the file sections being loaded. When the file has
      finished loading, the debugger will ask you to 'press any key to
      continue'.

   4. The default setup for FUNC.DSK is to generate random noise. Press "X"
      (EXECUTE) followed by "G" (GO) you will hear the random noise from
      the audio output port.  Changing the value at memory location 0xF0D,
      will generate a sinusoid output. This is done by hitting "F" for FILL,
      followed by "D" for DATA memory. At the FILL MEMORY sub-menu, type 0F0D
      for address, 1 for length <hit enter> and 1 for pattern <hit enter>. Now
      change PC to starting address(0xA00) by pressing "M" to MODIFY and then
      "R" for REGISTER. At the prompt type 'PC=0a00' and enter. Hit enter again
      to return back to assembly screen. You have just modified the PC register
      contents to address 0xa00. Go ahead and run the program again (XG). This
      time you will hear the sinewave output.

  5.  Changing the sampling rate will generate a different frequency of sinwave.
      To do this you need to change the contents on memory 0xF00 & 0xF01. These
      two position contain the value of the TA and RA registers respecively on
      AIC. (For more information on how the AIC determines the sampling rate
      please refer to Appendix B of the DSK User's Guide). After modifying the
      TA and RA registers, restart the program from the beginning in order to
      re-initalize the AIC with the new TA and RA values.


III. DSK_SPEC.DSK
     ============
   1. Connect the DSK to the RS232 properly and copy DSK_SPEC.DSK to the
      working directory.

   2. Connect an oscilloscope to the output jack and a microphone to the input
      jack of the DSK.

   3. Run the test file by typing the following
         DSK5L DSK_SPEC.DSK -C1          (If using comport 1)
         DSK5L DSK_SPEC.DSK -C2          (If using comport 2)

      The parameters passed to DSK5L instruct it to load the file named
      DSK_SPEC.DSK and execute.

   4. Turn on the oscilloscope power. Adjust the trigger and SEC/DIV until you
      are able to see the spectrum of the DSK input signal.
